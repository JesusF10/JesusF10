## 👋 Hello! I'm Jesus Flores

I'm a **Computer Science student** passionate about **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**. Currently, I'm diving into these fields by working on personal projects and exploring real-world data. My goal is to apply what I've learned in practical ways and continue growing my expertise in these areas. 

## 🌱 What I'm Learning
- Machine Learning algorithms and techniques (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning)
- Data analysis with **Python**, using libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**
- Model building and evaluation with **scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
