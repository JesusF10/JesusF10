# 👋 Hello! I'm [Your Name]

I'm a **Computer Science student** passionate about **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**. Currently, I'm diving into these fields by working on personal projects and exploring real-world data. My goal is to apply what I've learned in practical ways and continue growing my expertise in these areas. 

## 🌱 What I'm Learning
- Machine Learning algorithms and techniques (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning)
- Data analysis with **Python**, using libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**
- Model building and evaluation with **scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

## 🚀 Current Projects
Here are some of the projects I’m currently working on:
- **[Predicting House Prices](link-to-repo)**: A machine learning project that uses linear regression to predict housing prices based on historical data.
- **[Sentiment Analysis](link-to-repo)**: A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that classifies text sentiment using a logistic regression model.
- **[Titanic Survival Prediction](link-to-repo)**: A data science project based on the famous Titanic dataset.

You can find more projects on my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/your-username?tab=repositories). I’m always open to feedback and collaboration!
